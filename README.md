## [Project 1 - Explore Weather Trends](https://github.com/IvanBabkin/Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20Explore%20Weather%20Trends)
The purpose of this project is to analyze local and global temperature data and compare Edinburgh's and overall global temperature trends. The required data was extracted from Udacity's database using SQL code, while the analysis was carried out using Python with the results presented in a pdf document.
## [Project 2 - Investigate a Dataset (TMDb Dataset Analysis)](https://github.com/IvanBabkin/Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20Investigate%20a%20Dataset%20(TMDb%20Dataset%20Analysis))
The purpose of this project is to analyse a dataset and then communicate the findings. The Movie Database (TMDb) dataset was used for this project. This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from TMDb, including user ratings and revenue. The main analysis is regarding what affects the score of a particular movie represented by the 'vote_average' column.
## [Project 3 - Analyze AB Test Results](https://github.com/IvanBabkin/Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project%203%20-%20Analyze%20AB%20Test%20Results)
The aim of this project is to perform and understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to make a recommendation on whether they should implement the new webpage, keep the old webpage, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
## [Project 4 - Wrangle and Analyze Data](https://github.com/IvanBabkin/Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project%204%20-%20Wrangle%20and%20Analyze%20Data)
The aim of this project is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualisations. More specifically, the purpose is to use Python and its libraries to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. Then, to assess data quality and tidiness before cleaning to prepare it for analysis and finally, to analyse the clean data through visualisations.
## [Project 5 - Communicate Data Findings (United States Delayed Flights Dataset Visualisation and Exploration)](https://github.com/IvanBabkin/Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project%205%20-%20Communicate%20Data%20Findings%20(United%20States%20Delayed%20Flights%20Dataset%20Visualisation%20and%20Exploration))
This project has two parts and aims to demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. The purpose of the first part is to use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a United States Delayed Flights dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. The purpose of the second part is to produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that were discovered in the selected dataset. The primary method of conveying these findings will be through transforming exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
